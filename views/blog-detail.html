            From monolithic applications to microservices and serverless computing—explore how web architecture has transformed and what approach might work best for your next project. This evolution reflects broader changes in development practices, infrastructure capabilities, and user expectations.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The Monolithic Era</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            Traditionally, web applications were built as monolithic structures—single, unified codebases responsible for handling everything from user interface to data persistence. This approach offered simplicity in development and deployment but presented challenges as applications grew in complexity.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            In a monolithic architecture, all components of the application are interconnected and interdependent. This means that even small changes require testing and deploying the entire application, making the development cycle longer and increasing the risk of introducing bugs.
          </p>
          
          <div class="bg-secondary p-6 rounded-lg my-8 border-l-4 border-yellow-400">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Key Limitations of Monolithic Architecture:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
              <li>Scaling challenges: You must scale the entire application rather than just the components under heavy load</li>
              <li>Technology constraints: The whole application typically uses the same stack, limiting flexibility</li>
              <li>Complexity: As the application grows, the codebase becomes harder to understand and maintain</li>
              <li>Development bottlenecks: Larger teams face coordination challenges when working on a single codebase</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The Rise of Microservices</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            As organizations sought more scalable, flexible approaches to web development, microservices emerged as a compelling alternative. This architectural style structures applications as collections of loosely coupled services, each implementing a specific business function.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            Microservices communicate through well-defined APIs, typically over HTTP with REST or gRPC protocols. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing teams to work in parallel and choose technologies best suited for specific functionality.
          </p>

          <figure class="my-8">

              Microservices architecture enables independent deployment and scaling of components
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Benefits of Microservices:</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6 text-gray-300">
            <li>Improved scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on demand</li>
            <li>Technology diversity: Teams can select the best tools for each specific service</li>
            <li>Development agility: Smaller, focused teams can work on different services simultaneously</li>
            <li>Resilience: Failures are isolated to individual services rather than bringing down the entire system</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            However, microservices introduce their own set of challenges. Distributed systems are inherently more complex to develop, test, and maintain. Issues like network latency, data consistency, and service discovery require careful consideration and specialized knowledge.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Serverless Architecture: The Next Evolution</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            Serverless computing represents a further evolution in web architecture, abstracting away infrastructure management entirely. In this model, developers focus solely on writing code, while cloud providers handle the execution environment, scaling, and availability.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions enable developers to deploy individual functions that run in response to specific events. This approach naturally encourages a highly decoupled architecture and can significantly reduce operational overhead.
          </p>
          
          <div class="bg-yellow-500/20 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-yellow-400">Serverless Advantages:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
              <li>Reduced operational complexity: No server management or capacity planning required</li>
              <li>Cost efficiency: Pay only for actual compute time used, not idle capacity</li>
              <li>Auto-scaling: Seamless handling of traffic spikes without manual intervention</li>
              <li>Reduced time-to-market: Focus on business logic rather than infrastructure</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            While compelling for many use cases, serverless architectures aren't suitable for all applications. Cold start latency, execution time limits, and potential vendor lock-in are important considerations when evaluating this approach.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Hybrid Approaches and Modern Best Practices</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            In practice, many organizations adopt hybrid architectures that blend elements from different approaches based on their specific requirements. For example, an application might use microservices for core business functionality while leveraging serverless functions for event processing or image manipulation.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            Modern web architectures also increasingly incorporate patterns like:
          </p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 my-4 text-gray-300">
            <li><strong>API Gateways:</strong> Centralized entry points for client requests that handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and request routing</li>
            <li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> Systems designed around the production, detection, and reaction to events rather than direct service-to-service communication</li>
            <li><strong>Container Orchestration:</strong> Platforms like Kubernetes that automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications</li>
            <li><strong>Service Mesh:</strong> Infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication, offering features like traffic management, security, and observability</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Choosing the Right Architecture</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            There is no one-size-fits-all solution in web architecture. The best approach depends on various factors including:
          </p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 my-4 text-gray-300">
            <li>Application complexity and scale</li>
            <li>Team size and expertise</li>
            <li>Deployment and scaling requirements</li>
            <li>Performance constraints</li>
            <li>Budget considerations</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            For smaller applications with limited complexity, a monolithic approach may still offer the most straightforward path to delivery. As applications grow and requirements become more complex, incorporating elements of microservices or serverless architecture can provide valuable benefits.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 my-5 leading-relaxed">
            The evolution of web architecture reflects our industry's continuous search for better ways to build scalable, resilient, and maintainable applications. Understanding the strengths and limitations of different architectural approaches empowers developers to make informed decisions that align with their specific requirements.

                  Great point, Anna! The JAMstack approach definitely deserves mention. It's particularly powerful for content-heavy sites where performance and security are priorities. I'm planning a follow-up article specifically on JAMstack - stay tuned!
